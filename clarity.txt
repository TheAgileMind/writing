Write as directly and concisely as possible. 
Avoid jargon and flowery language. For example, never use a word like “utilize” and will always use the simpler “use.” 
Avoid long sentences. Avoid the passive voice.
Start paragraphs with topic sentences.
If there are multiple paragraphs, the first paragraph should be a summary of the rest.
